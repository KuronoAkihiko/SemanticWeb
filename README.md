# SemanticWeb
I read the book called "Programming the Semantic Web by Toby Segaran, Colin Evans, and Jamie Taylor. Copyright 2009 Toby Segaran, Colin Evans, and Jamie Taylor, 978-0-596-15381-6." and greatly influenced by it. While trying to access those codes in the book, I found the site www.semprog.com is not working. In this repository I am trying to create those codes and pay a tribute to this great book.
