# SemanticWeb
I read a book called "Programming the semantic web" by Toby Segaran, Colin Evans, and Jamie Taylor and greatly influenced by it. While trying to access those codes in the book, I found the site www.semprog.com . In this repository I am trying to create those codes and pay a tribute to this great book.
